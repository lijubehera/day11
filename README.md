Day 11 of My Python Learning Journey – Understanding Sets in Python

Today I explored Sets in Python – a powerful data structure that helps manage unique, unordered data efficiently.

What is a Set?
A set is a collection of unordered, unindexed, and unique items. Think of it like a bag where no duplicate items are allowed.

Key Features of Sets:
Unordered – Items do not maintain any order.

No duplicates – Every element is unique.

Mutable – You can add or remove elements after creation.

Defined using curly braces {} or the set() function.

Why Use Sets?
✅ To remove duplicate values from a list.
✅ For fast membership testing (if item in set).
✅ For set operations like union, intersection, difference — very useful in logic-based tasks.

Common Use Cases:
Removing duplicates from datasets.

Comparing two datasets for similarities or differences.

Filtering unique elements from a list.

Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine collecting unique stamps — even if someone gives you the same stamp again, you only keep one of each kind. That’s how sets work!
